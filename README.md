# product-categorization
A supervised machine learning model to categorize products into different categories based on the product title. Using these categories, advertisements can be displayed to different customers based on their preferences. 
This is specifically helpful for promoting small business on payment platforms like PayPal.

This repository contains the jupyter notebook that describes all the phases from data collection, model selection to category prediction.

The `datasets.zip` contains:
- the transactions of all users over a specific period of time
-  the merchants who want to advertise their products
- the products data used for training the model.
